# Welcome to my "blog"!

I created this blog for the sole purpose of sharing a little bit about my projects as well as my opinions on different matters.

It's a pleasure to have you here!

Let me tell you a little about myself :

I'm Louis Richard! The one from [Richard486](https://richard486.ch).

I'm a computer scientist, local repair guy, tech hoarder and Linux enthousiast. I've spent my whole life around computers and my love for the Core 2 Duo is almost as strong as my hate for proprietary software and non-standard hardware.

As of me creating this post, still jobless but working on different stuff like Mac repairs and smartphone screen replacements. 

Thank you for having an interest in what I do!
